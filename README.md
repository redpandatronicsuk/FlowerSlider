FlowerSlider
============

Angular Directive for a multi-slider interface. Originally all sliders were rotated around a central point and getting bigger as you move away from the center, looking like a flower. Newer versions allow different arrangements of the sliders altogether. Sliders graphics are SVG based and generated with D3.
